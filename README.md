# Python-Discord-BOT
A bot for discord coded in python

A common issue with the discord server I was in with my friends was that the bot that announces what games are free didn't work properly. I decided to give it a try since
it seemed like a relatively intermediate task at the time. I used a discord API and an epic games store api to communicate with discord and with the epic games store respectively.
Unfortunately I couldn't find an api for the steam store that allowed me to grab a catalog of 100% discounted games so I decided this was a nice place to try and learn
the basics of selenium.
